          "name": "Transformer",
          "description": "A type of neural network architecture that has become increasingly popular in natural language processing tasks. It is composed of three main components: the input embedding, the self-attention mechanism, and the output linear layer. The self-attention mechanism is the core component of transformers, allowing the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. By understanding these components and their relationships, developers and researchers can better design and improve transformer-based models.",
